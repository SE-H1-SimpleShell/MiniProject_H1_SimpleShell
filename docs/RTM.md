# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

Maps every requirement to the use case that realises it, the source module that implements it, the
Jira issue that tracks it, and the test that verifies it.

Use case identifiers are defined in `docs/Use_Case_Catalog.md`. Verification identifiers for the
non-functional requirements are defined in `docs/Test_Cases.md`.

## 1. Functional requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Use Case | Implementation | Test Cases | Coverage | Jira | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | Interactive input | UC-01 | `src/shell.c` | TC-01, TC-10 | Automated | SH-REQ-01 | Work in progress |
| FR-02 | External command execution | UC-03, UC-04 | `src/executor.c` | TC-02 | Automated | SH-REQ-02 | Work in progress |
| FR-03 | Built-in commands | UC-05, UC-10 | `src/builtins.c`, `src/executor.c` | TC-03, TC-04, TC-18 | Automated | SH-REQ-03 | Work in progress |
| FR-04 | Command parsing | UC-02 | `src/parser.c` | TC-05, TC-06, TC-11 | Automated | SH-REQ-04 | Work in progress |
| FR-05 | Input/output redirection | UC-06 | `src/parser.c`, `src/executor.c` | TC-07, TC-08, TC-09 | Automated | SH-REQ-05 | Work in progress |
| FR-06 | Pipelines | UC-07 | `src/parser.c`, `src/executor.c` | TC-12 | Automated | SH-REQ-06 | Work in progress |
| FR-07 | Background execution | UC-08 | `src/parser.c`, `src/executor.c` | TC-13 | Automated | SH-REQ-07 | Work in progress |
| FR-08 | Error handling | UC-02, UC-09 | `src/shell.c`, `src/parser.c`, `src/executor.c`, `src/builtins.c` | TC-11, TC-14, TC-15 | Automated | SH-REQ-08 | Work in progress |
| FR-09 | Process synchronization | UC-03, UC-04 | `src/executor.c` | TC-16 | Automated | SH-REQ-09 | Work in progress |
| FR-10 | Clean termination | UC-10 | `src/shell.c`, `src/builtins.c` | TC-01, TC-10 | Automated | SH-REQ-10 | Work in progress |

## 2. Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements are verified by the procedures NFRV-01 … NFRV-08 rather than by
functional test cases.

| Req ID | Requirement | Use Case | Verification | Method | Jira | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-01 | Reliability | All | NFRV-01, TC-17 | Repeated stress and regression runs; ASan/UBSan build | SH-NFR-01 | Work in progress |
| NFR-02 | Maintainability | N/A | NFRV-02 | Module/header separation review | SH-NFR-02 | Work in progress |
| NFR-03 | Memory safety | N/A | NFRV-03 | `make asan-test` with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer | SH-NFR-03 | Work in progress |
| NFR-04 | Usability | All | NFRV-04 | Prompt and diagnostic message review | SH-NFR-04 | Work in progress |
| NFR-05 | Portability | N/A | NFRV-05 | Build with GCC, C11, POSIX APIs on the target Linux system | SH-NFR-05 | Work in progress |
| NFR-06 | Testability | N/A | NFRV-06 | CI runs `make test` on every push and pull request | SH-NFR-06 | Work in progress |
| NFR-07 | Security hygiene | N/A | NFRV-07 | Malformed-input suite; source check that `system()` is not used | SH-NFR-07 | Work in progress |
| NFR-08 | Documentation | N/A | NFRV-08 | Documentation review against the supported syntax and limits | SH-NFR-08 | Work in progress |

## 3. Traceability rules

1. Every requirement has a unique, stable identifier.
2. Every FR maps to a use case, an implementation module, a Jira issue, and at least one test case.
3. Every NFR maps to a named verification procedure rather than a functional test case.
4. Jira issue status and this matrix are updated after each accepted change.
5. A requirement is not considered **verified** until implementation, review, and recorded
   validation evidence all exist. `Status` in this table records **implementation** only; the
   recorded run evidence lives in `docs/Test_Report.md`.

## 4. Coverage gaps

These are known and deliberately left open rather than silently reported as covered.

| Gap | Affected | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Stress/regression is not covered by an automated test | FR-01 / NFR-01, TC-17 | Run manually before release. |
