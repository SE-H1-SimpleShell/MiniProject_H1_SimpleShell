## 1. Implementation Status

The following core and advanced features are merged into `main` and verified through automated CI:

- **Interactive Command Loop:** Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) displaying `simple-shell$ ` prompt on `stderr`, processing user input line-by-line, and gracefully handling EOF (`Ctrl-D`) and `exit`.
- **Built-in Commands:** Parent-process execution of `cd` (including `cd -` OLDPWD and `cd` to `HOME`), `pwd`, `echo`, `help`, and `exit` with standard output buffer flushing.
- **External Command Execution:** Process creation using `fork()`, standard executable searching and execution via `execvp()`, and parent process synchronization via `waitpid()`.
- **Lexical Analysis & Quoting:** Whitespace tokenization, literal single quotes (`'...'`), double quotes (`"..."`) with embedded quote and backslash escape handling, and unquoted backslash escapes (`\ `).
- **I/O Redirection:** Input redirection `<` (`O_RDONLY`), output overwrite redirection `>` (`O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC`), and output append redirection `>>` (`O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND`) for both built-in and external commands.
- **Multi-Stage Pipelines:** Inter-process communication pipelines (`|`) supporting up to 32 concurrent stages with intermediate descriptor cleanup, deadlock avoidance on large data streams, and child-process isolation for built-ins in pipelines.
- **Background Execution:** Asynchronous command execution (`&`) returning control immediately to the prompt.
- **Asynchronous Zombie Reaping:** `SIGCHLD` signal handler writing to an internal self-pipe, multiplexed with standard input via `poll()`, reaping background children and reporting termination diagnostics in real time without blocking.
- **Operator Pre-Validation:** Syntax validation rejecting duplicate background operators (`&&`, `& &`), misplaced `&`, duplicate redirections, and limits before process spawning or file creation.

Development is feature-complete and tagged `v1.0-final` (12 November 2026). The final demonstration
evidence remains tracked in issue #18; the joint review and sign-off is tracked in issue #30.
