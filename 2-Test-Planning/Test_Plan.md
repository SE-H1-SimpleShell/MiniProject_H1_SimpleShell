## Document Control

| Version | Date | Author | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | Phase 1 | Team H1 | Initial test plan |
| 2.0 | 12 November 2026 | Team H1 | Restructured to IEEE 829/29119-3; Sections 3–5 expanded and security validation added as Section 5.1 |

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This plan defines how Simple Shell is verified against the requirements in `docs/SRS.md`. It
identifies the test items, the features to be tested and excluded, the test approach, the
pass/fail criteria, the security validation, and the deliverables and evidence that must be
retained.

### 1.2 Scope

**In scope:** interactive input and termination; built-in commands; external commands; whitespace,
quotes, escapes, and operators; input/output redirection; pipelines (2 to 32 stages); background
execution and asynchronous reaping; malformed input; missing commands and files; process and
resource handling; security validation of the parser boundary; CI and sanitizer checks.

**Out of scope:** full POSIX shell scripting, variable expansion, globbing, command substitution,
aliases, full job control, remote services, and tests against systems not owned by the team.

### 2.3 Features Not to Be Tested

Full POSIX shell compliance, shell variables, glob expansion, command substitution, aliases,
scripting, terminal job control, and network behaviour are out of scope. Penetration testing is
planned but not executed in this phase; see Section 5.1.4.

### 2.4 Test Environment

Linux (x86_64 or the agreed team VM), GCC in C11 mode, GNU Make, Bash, GitHub Actions
(`ubuntu-latest`), AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and Valgrind. Record the OS and
compiler versions, commit SHA, commands, and complete output for every reported run.

## 3. Test Approach

### 3.1 Test Levels and Methods

| Level | Method | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Unit/component | Parser and direct executor harnesses | Parser and executor output |
| Integration | Shell command scenarios through `tests/test_shell.sh` | Actual integration-test output |
| Robustness/security | Malformed input, missing files, limits, repeated runs | Inputs, outputs, and sanitizer diagnostics |
| System/acceptance | Fresh clone, build, and command demonstration | Test report and demo evidence |
| CI | GitHub Actions on push and pull request | Workflow URL and status |

### 3.2 Test Techniques and Coverage

- **Boundary-value analysis:** argument count at 128/129, pipeline stages at 32/33, descriptor
  limit at 64.
- **Equivalence partitioning:** valid versus malformed operators, valid versus missing files,
  foreground versus background commands, built-in versus external stages.
- **Error-guessing and negative testing:** unterminated quotes, trailing backslash, leading or
  trailing `|`, duplicate redirections, non-final `&`.
- **Concurrency and deadlock testing:** large data streams (`seq 50000 | cat | wc -l`) and early
  consumer exit (`yes | cat | head -n 1`).
- **State and side-effect checks:** rejected syntax must not create or truncate files, change
  directories, or spawn processes.
- **Sanitizer and Valgrind runs:** repeat the functional suites under ASan/UBSan and the unit
  harnesses under Valgrind.

### 3.3 Test Procedure and Commands

From a clean checkout:

```bash
make clean
make
make test
make asan-test
```

`make test` runs the parser harness (63 assertions), executor harness (29 tests), shell integration suite (70 scenarios), and termination cleanup harness (`tests/test_termination.py`, 2 checks) — 164 checks per build. `make asan-test`
rebuilds with `-fsanitize=address,undefined` and repeats the same 164 checks. Use `make asan-test`, not
`make asan && make test`: `make asan` only produces a sanitized binary, and the following
`make test` would rebuild without sanitizer flags, so nothing would actually be validated under
ASan or UBSan.

The complete local sequence used for release evidence is:

```bash
make clean && make all && make test && make asan-test && make valgrind && make ci
```

`make ci` runs the consolidated build, functional, sanitizer, and cleanliness targets. The same
sequence is executed by `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on every push and pull request.

### 3.4 Test Data and Fixtures

| Fixture | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Temporary files under `/tmp/simple-shell-test-*` | Redirection input, overwrite, and append checks |
| `/dev/null` and a missing path | Input-redirection success and failure checks |
| Generated streams (`seq`, `yes`) | Pipeline deadlock and SIGPIPE checks |
| Repeated 2-stage and 4-stage pipelines under `ulimit -n 64` | Descriptor-leak checks |
| Malformed command strings | Parser rejection and side-effect checks |

Fixtures are created and removed by the harnesses; no test depends on files committed to the
repository outside `tests/`.

### 3.5 Defect Lifecycle and Retest

Reproduce → link to requirement/test and issue → patch on a feature branch → add a regression test
→ run focused and regression tests → open PR → review and CI → merge → record retest evidence.

### 3.6 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Test owner | Maintains this plan, test cases, and RTM coverage |
| Developers | Add regression tests with each fix and keep `make test` green |
| Reviewers | Verify the test evidence in the PR and on CI |
| CI | Executes the build, test, sanitizer, Valgrind, and cleanliness jobs |

## 4. Pass/Fail Criteria

### 4.1 Entry Criteria

- Source, headers, and tests are checked out at the target commit.
- GCC, Make, Bash, and (for the audit target) Valgrind are available.
- The target commit SHA and expected results are identified.
- The test environment matches Section 2.4.

### 4.2 Pass/Fail Criteria by Test Level

| Level | Pass condition | Fail condition |
|---|---|---|
| Unit/component | All parser and executor assertions pass | Any assertion fails, crashes, or hangs |
| Integration | All shell scenarios return the expected output and exit status | Wrong output, unexpected side effect, or hang |
| Robustness/security | Malformed input is rejected with a diagnostic; no file or process side effect; no sanitizer finding | Crash, leak, sanitizer report, or side effect |
| Sanitizer | ASan/UBSan report zero errors and zero leaks | Any sanitizer diagnostic |
| Valgrind | No invalid memory access and no leaked parser memory | Valgrind error or leak |
| CI | All jobs succeed on the target commit | Any job fails or is skipped without justification |

Any test that exceeds the harness timeout (30 seconds for the executor pipeline alarm; 15 minutes
for the CI job) is recorded as a failure, not retried silently.

### 4.3 Suspension and Resumption Criteria

**Suspend testing when:**

- The build does not compile on the target environment.
- A blocking defect prevents the suite from completing.
- CI infrastructure is unavailable for more than one working day.
- The target commit or environment changes during a run.

**Resume when:**

- The blocking fix is merged and CI is green.
- The environment is restored and the commit SHA is re-identified.
- The affected tests are re-run from a clean checkout.

### 4.4 Exit Criteria

- Automated tests are run and outcomes are recorded.
- Failures and deviations are explained, fixed, and re-tested.
- Manual coverage gaps are exercised or documented as unresolved.
- Sanitizer output and the test report reflect real evidence.
- Every FR has at least one executed test case and every NFR has an executed verification
  procedure.
- Security validation SEC-01 … SEC-06 has recorded evidence, with any untested technique listed
  as a limitation.

### 4.5 Metrics and Reporting

| Metric | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Functional test case pass rate | 100% of executed cases | `docs/Test_Report.md` |
| Sanitizer findings | 0 | `make asan-test` output |
| Valgrind findings | 0 | `make valgrind` output |
| Hang/timeout failures | 0 | Harness logs |
| Requirements covered | 100% of FR and NFR | `docs/RTM.md` |
| CI success on target commit | All jobs pass | GitHub Actions run |

Results are written to `docs/Test_Report.md`; the RTM coverage column is updated in the same change
set when a test is added or removed.

### 4.6 Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Flaky timing assertion under sanitizers | False failure | Record the run honestly, re-run the full suite, and keep the timing assertion bounded |
| Environment differences (WSL vs CI) | Non-reproducible result | Record OS, compiler, and runner; treat CI as the release gate |
| Long-running or hanging pipelines | Blocked suite | 30-second alarm in the executor harness and CI timeouts |
| Descriptor exhaustion | Misleading pass | Repeat pipelines under `ulimit -n 64` and compare descriptor counts |
| Incomplete system-call fault injection | Unverified error paths | Document the gap in `docs/RTM.md` Section 4 and retain it as a known limitation |

## 5. Test Deliverables and Security Validation

### 5.1 Security Validation

#### 5.1.1 Security Scope and Threat Model

Security validation focuses on the parser because it processes untrusted input. The executor is a
secondary boundary: it forwards already validated tokens to `fork`/`execvp`. The threat model
assumes a local user who can type arbitrary text, redirect files they own, and stress resource
limits. Privilege escalation, persistence, network attacks, and attacks on other systems are out
of scope.

#### 5.1.2 Security Validation Activities

| ID | Activity | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| SEC-01 | Malformed syntax: unterminated quotes, trailing backslash, leading/trailing pipe, non-final `&`, duplicate redirections | Each is rejected with an error and the shell stays usable |
| SEC-02 | Argument and segment exhaustion beyond the documented limits | Rejected cleanly with no overflow or leak |
| SEC-03 | Missing and unreadable files in redirections | Error reported, shell remains usable |
| SEC-04 | Non-existent command and non-executable targets | Error reported, shell remains usable |
| SEC-05 | Source review of external execution | `fork` + `execvp` used; no `system()`, no unintended second shell layer |
| SEC-06 | Sanitizer run of the malformed-input suite | No memory or undefined-behaviour findings |

These activities map to security requirements SR-01 … SR-04 (SRS Section 3.4.2) and to the
verification procedures NFRV-03 and NFRV-07.

#### 5.1.3 Security Pass/Fail Criteria

- **Pass:** every SEC activity produces the documented safe outcome; no file or process side effect
  occurs before rejection; no sanitizer finding; source review finds no `system(` call.
- **Fail:** a malformed command crashes or terminates the shell, creates or truncates a file,
  spawns a process before validation, or produces an ASan/UBSan diagnostic.
- **Not tested:** penetration-style fuzzing is not executed in this phase and is reported as a
  limitation, not as a pass.

#### 5.1.4 Penetration Testing Status

Penetration testing is **planned only**. `docs/Validation_Specification.md` Section 8 defines the
authorisation, scope, threat model, eight planned techniques (PEN-01 … PEN-08), tooling
(AFL++/libFuzzer, ASan/UBSan, Valgrind), and explicit prohibitions. No penetration test is claimed
as executed here.

### 5.2 Test Deliverables

| Deliverable | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Test Plan (this document) | `2-Test-Planning/Test_Plan.md` | Final |
| Test Cases and NFR procedures | `2-Test-Planning/Test_Cases.md`, `docs/Test_Cases.md` | Final |
| Validation and security specification | `2-Test-Planning/Validation_Specification.md` | Final |
| Requirements Traceability Matrix | `docs/RTM.md` | Maintained |
| Test Execution Report | `docs/Test_Report.md` | Recorded |
| Resource audit report | `docs/Resource_Audit.md` | Recorded |
| CI run logs and summaries | GitHub Actions `CI` workflow | Available |
| Demo and acceptance evidence | `9-Demo/Demo_Evidence_Index.md` | Maintained |

### 5.3 Traceability to the SRS

| SRS requirements | Test coverage | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| FR-01 … FR-10 | TC-01 … TC-18 | `docs/Test_Report.md`, CI logs |
| NFR-01 … NFR-08 | NFRV-01 … NFRV-08 | `docs/Test_Report.md`, `docs/Resource_Audit.md` |
| SR-01 … SR-04, SO-01 … SO-03 | SEC-01 … SEC-06 | `docs/Validation_Specification.md` Section 7, sanitizer and source-review evidence |

The canonical row-by-row mapping is `docs/RTM.md`. The functional suite currently defines 18 test
cases and the non-functional suite defines 8 verification procedures, exceeding the 7–10 test-case
minimum while covering every FR and NFR.

### 5.4 Reporting and Evidence Retention

Every run records the commit SHA, operating system, compiler version, command, and complete output.
The Test Report retains failed or flaky runs together with their resolution; expected output is
never presented as observed output. CI logs are retained by GitHub Actions for the repository
retention period, and the canonical summaries are committed under `docs/`.
